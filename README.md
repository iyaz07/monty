Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
This project aims to create a functional interpreter for a simple stack-based (LIFO)programming language and involves parsing, interpreting, and executing bytecode instructions in the specified format. The provided data structures (stack_t and instruction_t) serve as the foundation for implementing the required functionality.
